Inspired by ["Build Your Own Redis" Challenge](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x).


This project is a simplified version of the popular in-memory data structure store (Redis), implemented in Go. It is designed to handle basic commands such as `PING`, `SET` (supports expiration) and `GET`, and serves as a learning resource for me to understand the inner workings of ["Redis"](https://redis.io/).

### Start server
```sh
make run_server
```

### Run tests
```sh

```
