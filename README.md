This code is a simple implementation of a 
["Build Your Own Redis" Challenge](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x).

For this challenge, I developed a simplified version of Redis that is capable of executing basic commands such as `PING`, `SET` (supports expiration) and `GET`. 

### Start server
```sh
make run_server
```

### Run tests
```sh
make run_tests
```
